# The Dezh Technologies Official Website

Welcome to the repository for the main website of Dezh Technology. This README will provide you with essential information about the project structure, setup instructions, available scripts, and deployment process.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the source code for the main website of Dezh Technology. The website is built using React, Tailwind CSS, and Vite for fast and efficient development. TypeScript is used for static typing and improved code maintainability.

## Adding Logos to Partners Section

If anyone wants to add their logo to our partners section, they should follow these steps:

1. Add the logo with `230px 80px` size and `#FFFFFF` color to the `public/companies` directory with an `.svg` extension. The SVG name should be the company or team name. For example, `google.svg`.

2. Change the `data/companies.json` file and add their information. The JSON structure should be as follows:

    ```json
    {
        "name": "Name",
        "logo": "/companies/name.svg",
        "website": "https://example.com"
    }
